                        I am Joey van Lieshout (online known as Alice Everglade ), I am 21 years old and what most would call, a "nerd". <br>
                        ever since I was about 10 years old I was fervorously learning things like <br>
                        mathematics, chemistry, physics, biology and my favorite, astrophysics. <br>
                        this eventually over a long time developed into a love for game development due to my hobby being Gaming from a fairly young age.

                <h3>Study</h3> <br>
                in highschool (a level of highschool called HAVO), I had no trouble with any of the previously mentioned subjects, <br>
                I often got exception for my homework and thus went through HAVO with decent ease. <br>
                I did do the 4th year over but that was due to going to america to participate in the "First Robotics Competition" with a team from Fontys. <br>
                After highschool I went on to study HBO (bachelor) Applied Science which is simply put just chemistry and micro biology. <br>
                I left this course half a year in while having perfectly good grades due to a lack of interest in persuing this field for the rest of my studying career. <br>
                Two weeks after leaving, I was able to start a HBO IT course at fontys, this went wrong due to Covid-19 and thus I tried to start half a year later once again. <br>
                I noticed that I was yearning for a more creative outlet and thus left Fonthys and HBO all together.<br>
                Now I have arrived at SintLucas and feel like I found my spot. <br> <br> <br> <br>
                <h3>Hobbies</h3> <br>
                As stated before, I have been a fan of gaming since I can remember, when I was young I was mostly playing games like Pokemon and some random M&M game on the playstation. <br>
                the first game I can remember that really got me hooked was Legends of Zelda: Skyward Sword. <br> 
                this has sparked my interest in writing a story in an interesting world with lots of lore. <br>
                as I got my own computer I started playing a korean MMO RPG called Blade and Soul which I then proceeded to spend 6 years of my life on. <br>
                when I finally escaped the cluthces of MMOs I started to play various games. <br>
                most notibly Osu!, League of Legends, DnD, A dance of fire and ice, minecraft and my most favorite game up to this point and probably for the years to come, Celeste. <br>
                if I were to take inspiration from these games for a dream game I wish to make it would have to be the fast paced complex combat of Blade and Soul combined with the unlimited speed cap of Celeste, then adding in a momentum based damage calculation. <br> <br>
                <h3>Skills and Career</h3> <br>
                I have set my eyes on becoming an Indie Game Developer and thus wish to learn about anything related to game development, not just software. <br>
                I have a decent amount of experience in C# and Unity but would love to learn more about things like unreal or making my own game engine, <br>
                other than skills in coding I enjoy working out chemistry and physics in games and try to learn as much as I can about this on the side. <br>
                I am still lacking in the artistic side of game development so I would love to get the opportunity to work on these skills. <br> <br>
